				<p>
					Welcome my friend! My name is Parveen and I'm a design leader working in the SF Bay Area. I'm a design generalist with deep experience working on solving complex creative problems and creating efficient design processes for everything from enterprises to early stage startups. 
				</p>
				<p>
					And yet my first love growing up was creative storytelling and have had experience writing novels, short stories, and screenplays. If you asked me my dream job in high school, it would have been to write and direct motion pictures as I think its the most effective way to engage an audience. Now I bring that background to every project I work on as I try to build products that engage it's users. This website is dedicated to the fusion of my past and present since it is what makes me whole.

		<p>Movies provide the best story experience of all (imho) and if I want to have a similar impact on my users, why not be inspired? Here are some stories I put together while playing off this theme. They are a bit long winded but if you just want to view the spoilers, scroll down or <a href="#spoilers">go here to see more screens.</a></p>
