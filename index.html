			Welcome my friend! My name is Parveen and I'm a design leader working in the SF Bay Area.

		<p>
				As a child, I dreamt of making movies so that I connect myself to others. But now as an adult, I make products so that I can connect people to each other. This is my portfolio where I take inspiration from the former to display the latter.

		<p>So what's with this movie theme? In my opinion, movies provide the best experience for a good story as it takes most of your senses and provides a full narrative in a concise package. Why not take that as proper inspiration to share my stories with you. If you don't care about the story and just want the spoilers, <a href="work.html">check this page out here.</a></p>
