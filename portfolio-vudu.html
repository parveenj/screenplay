                  Today’s entertainment world is scattered in so many directions that it can be challenging for anyone to keep up with the
                  content that matters to them. Add to the fact that we all have busy schedules and consume media with second
                  screens in our face.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was a problem that I had for myself as I tried to raise a family, maintain a career with emails coming 24/7, and take
                  graduate courses. I grew up in love with my stories as it added cultural relevance and entertainment to my
                  life. On top of this, I would have conversations with others and we would get into talking about movies and
                  TV shows and books and music and it always left me with the desire to catch up intriguing content. It’s not
                  like the old days where everyone consumed content in the same place through their local broadcast network
                  or radio station or library.

                  Life in general is too splintered and there has to be a more interesting way to manage this stuff. Yes, its not critical
                  to one’s life but when you include the arts, doesn’t it make life more fulfilling?

              <p>
                I consider this a unique problem but went into various app stores to find tools online or on mobile platforms. I largely
                came up empty as what I basically found was similar to something like GoWatchIt. I did sign up for a couple
                of them but each was a glorified queue and they simply didn’t have integration with as many products as I
                would like.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most queue products don’t actually take into account the various situations in which I could consume media and treats it
                all the same. In addition, I did not find anything that could incorporate additional media types such as
                books and music.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="carousel-item">
        <div class="container">
          <div class="row sp-slider-row">
            <div class="col-sm-4 align-self-center">
              <p>
                Is there a reason that there isn’t a service that bundles all kinds of media together? I did a search to see if services
                across platforms provided APIs and for the most part everything I looked up did provide the relevant data
                feeds.
              </p>
              <p>
                There might be some technical concerns about what data would get pulled from these APIs but I didn’t focus too much on that
                for this initial prototype. As long as some data could be pulled, there should be enough to incorporate it
                into the design.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-8 align-self-center">
              <img class="sp-slider-image-solo" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/585b8888d156253a81256ad88cc86e237734014f/93ee4/assets/images/story-vudu-4.png">

          </div>

      <div class="carousel-item">
        <div class="container sp-slide-solo">

            <div class="col">
              <p>
                So there can be a logical means to build a queue around multiple media types. That’s great and could be a valuable add into
                the marketplace but it’s not really enough. I mean, how is this different from just keeping a Google Sheet
                with links? The design problem here needed to be solved with a more advanced solution. Thus I wanted to take
                into account key factors that limit someone’s ability to make a choice about how to consume media.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="carousel-item">
        <div class="container">

            <div class="col-sm-5 align-self-center">
              <p>
                I thought through this interactive experience. With the onset of conversational UIs spreading the marketplace, I figured
                this would be a great way to make finding media less burdensome. I took some of the variables that could
                impact the what to consume and when and presented a branching diagram to make sure I covered all my bases.
                I was just focusing on this portion of my product as it was the most abstract and queue management can be
                leveraged on best practices that already existed.

                      Using my own family as users for this project, I mapped out user flows that would potentially take place. Sketching this

                    I needed to take this concept to a traditional wireframe to see if it all worked together. I shared this with a couple of
                    friends to get the feeling of whether it worked or not and got positive feedback, which inspired me to create
                    the mockups.

                I ventured into taking the initial wireframe concepts and created visual mockups in Sketch, starting first with the onboarding
                experience. My expectation was that these screens would serve as a book cover before getting into the app
                so it would be overall a darker and bolder visual design.

                I crafted a default list for an active user and put together key elements that I felt would be of most importance. There
                obviously had to be references to the order and metadata about the medium itself. In addition, the key element
                of time was included as well as indicators showing if the item was instantly accessible or not.

                Empty screens are usually areas for designers to skimp on but is something I always want to consider. I created a few screens
                with flow directions below of a user who has nothing in their queue and wants to search to add something.

                Finally the most unique aspect of this application is the conversation flow I wireframed earlier. Sadly as I was wireframing
                all of this, I realized the actual steps for interaction adds unnecessary burden on the user to interact.
                So I used the conversation form factor but provided all of the choices the user makes in cards subsequent
                to the questions above. I think this is more easily interactive and efficient overall for this particular
                use case.
