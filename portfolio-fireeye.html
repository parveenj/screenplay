                      FireEye is a top contender in the new wave of cybersecurity upstarts who are changing how enterprise companies think of protecting
                      their most important assets. I joined the small team of designers as the lead during a tumultous time when
                      the product roadmap was about to go through some major changes.

                      FireEye’s main front end framework had not changed since the company’s inception 10 years ago and in order to keep up with
                      the competition and meet customer requests, a new refresh on a new platform had to be built.

                  Even though it was antiquated, I performed an audit on all of the current interfaces to understand what was and was not working
                  well from a usability standpoint. I took notes as I went along since the interfaces are deep and complicated.

                  a lot of past research on the matter. To help my brain explore this narrative, I storyboarded a typical day
                  based on what I could dig up.

                  to 5 customers and help put together a presentation for the entire department to review.

                <p>
                  Our design team brainstormed a few concepts that needed to be evaluated such as giving users better insight and control over
                  their security landscape. We came up with new features that would help in these regards. The features were
                  introduced as a container for multiple alerts called Investigations.

                  With new concepts come new problems as we had to identify how the new features for Investigations would integrate with how
                  alerts were already being presented to users. The full design team worked through ideas via paper, whiteboards,
                  and sticky notes.

                  It was time to put together a few wireframes so that we could collaborate with the broader Engineering team. Our concepts
                  required a few iterations and we had ended up creating over 100 wireframes including the features we wanted
                  to incorporate.

                  Investigations resulted in over 50 unique screens that strung together into a cohesive flow which took our entire team weeks
                  upon weeks to get right. We would iterate with the rest of the Engineering and Product teams through collection
                  of feedback via sticky notes. Sometimes there wouldn’t be enough table space to review it all!

                  I shared our designs with the users I researched earlier via an interactive prototype in Axure. It was discovered that there
                  were problems with the Investigations concept. Each user was hesitant to abandon the existing Alerts experience
                  for fear of missing anything important due to transitioning to something new.

                <p>
                  After reviewing feedback internally, we decided to not pivot users into the Investigations experience but start to bleed
                  some much needed features into the existing Alerts experience. You can think of the new approach based on
                  this modified graphic.

                <p>
                  The new alerts experience was introduced with some of the features of Investigations without making users learn a new experience.
                  Giving users better insight was a key focus on features that were prioritized into this earlier release.

                    When we had motion to move forward with development, we had to create a better system of documenting features. I had been
                    introduced to Brad Frost’s Atomic Design concept and felt it was the perfect model to follow in terms of
                    production. This especially worked for me as I have a life science degree!

                    the components on internal wiki pages and flushed it out with some additional documentation such as microinteractions.
