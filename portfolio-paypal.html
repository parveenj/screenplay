              <p>I worked with the PayPal CIO Office in researching the lack of collaboration around the tools employees utilized across the company. I communicated my findings through data analysis, a narrative presentation, personas, a journey map, and a branded experience. This led to a campaign company wide.</p>

              <p>Even though PayPal has grown a lot over the years, it has always maintained a very agile culture. This has
                given different teams the freedom to have different workflows that suits their needs. Although its great
                at the team level, it means that there is not standard process for collaborating across the company. The
                OCIO has a need to streamline these tools and processes as a means to make the company leaner and more cost
                efficient.

                PayPal has an organization called the Office of the CIO (OCIO) and it is involved in shaping the culture of tools and technology
                across the entire company. This internal team listens to PayPal employees and their needs and implements
                solutions that benefit their work so that they can keep the company running in its best shape.

              <h3>WHO WORKS AT PAYPAL?</h3>
              <p>
                In order to better help the OCIO talk to their users, we had to get to know them better. Through the internal team collaboration,
                we revised an interview script of 22 questions that would lead us into getting to know the PayPal process
                flow better.

              <p>
                With over 22 interviewees providing answers to all of our questions, there was a ton of data to mine through. As a team,
                this involved whiteboard sessions to go through and pull out the findings.

              <h3>PERSONAS COME ALIVE</h3>
              <p>
                Finding the patterns out of the interviewees took some brainstorming and discussion but in the end, we were able to find
                5 unique personas that covered everyone to some degree. It also involved representing raw data that we identified
                from the analysis in meaningful ways.

              <h3>JOURNEY MAPPING</h3>
              <p>
                The next step involved identifying the various phases of the journey for each of the personas. With the personas and the
                data in hand, we started to identify phases of collaboration. This resulted in us needing to validate the
                findings with the interviewees through follow up sessions.

                Translating the ideas into a formal Journey Map took many iterations and reviews but resulted in representing all 5 Personas
                together to give some context of collaboration at PayPal.

              <p>
                In order to sell the overall vision of how the personas and journey map could be implemented, it was beneficial to show it
                could culminate in a sample of a branding campaign. The team put together branding materials that would mimic
                an actual campaign, complete with a name, logo, and marketing materials in the form of posters, web sites,
                email newsletters, and banners.

              <h3>HOW DID IT TURN OUT?</h3>
              <p>
                Our team presented the voice of the users to the OCIO. This was done as a joint effort between the Experience Design and
                Operation Effectiveness teams. The OCIO had previously focused internal efforts on just the tools that users
                implemented but Slalomâ€™s focus was to help them think more broadly, the people who use those tools. This
                was done via in-depth interviews across various user profiles. This resulted in personas, journey maps, and
                an adoption strategy that the OCIO could use to plan for more successful internal initiatives going forward.
