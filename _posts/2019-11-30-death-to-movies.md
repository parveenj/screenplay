I know what you are thinking: "Whoa whoa whoa, let me get this straight? You theme your site around movies and then turn around and say they are dead? Are you a hypocrite?" Let me unpack my message for you.

Movies were my lifeblood as a kid. Now, I didn't watch them endlessly (in fact, I still don't). I would consume them like a fine wine (well not when I was a kid ha ha). I would watch them as unique special experiences and savor the buildup to watching it as well as the aftermath after it was all said and done.

Nowadays? Well it seems like trying to have that cadence is almost nonexistent. I know I am so busy that I have little time to keep up with the latest movies so that has some impact obviously. But do movies even matter to pop culture in any meaningful manner anymore? Yes the occasional movie gets hyped up but its mostly superhero blockbusters or the rare award winning flick because of some Oscar campaign. We rarely have the kind of sticking power with movies as we are always off to the next screen.

Which is why I think the medium's impact is dead but not the medium itself. Movies themselves will be around forever but it will be like you stumbling across something on streaming and zipping through it in 2 hours time. There will be no anticipation for it and you will forget it quicker because your streaming platform has 200 new options to dive into. We don't sit back and simmer on anything and even think about what we experienced. 

I understand why Netflix and any other streaming service tries to force you to stay on their platform as much as possible. Not everyone wants to have a discussion about what they have watched. But when you don't think about it, you don't get to personalize what it means to you and it won't then mean as much to you. Life is busy, there are other things to watch and consume.

Unfortunately I don't see any way out of this. There is too much content and too much noise. It's hard to appreciate something as being a lasting artifact. I don't even cherish a satisfying movie for a long time anymore and most of my favorites are all over a decade old. I hope that streaming services means I can find and rewatch movies easily as maybe repeat viewings will help stick the landing.

Worst part of all of this? Lack of creativity. As mentioned before, there is a flood of the same blockbuster movies coming out that garner all the attention. Or the remake of a classic that nobody asked for but has brand awareness. Or bringing some familar toy product to life in a narrative format. Or trotting out the same character in a new adventure because we loved them as kids. It's all a lack of creativy but also because its a lack of risk taking. We won't remember as many movies from this decade and onward as being all time greats as we did in the 1960s, 70s, etc. In fact film creativity peaked in the 1970s as mainstream blockbuster movies back then were bespoke narratives. Just go back and look at what was the top box office draw each of those years and compare them to now.

Filmmakers who love to express themselves will have fewer options to find investment into their vision. Do you think the lack of risk taking will mean that production companies will fund some random kid's vision to be the next Scorcese or Speilberg? Making movies is getting more and more expensive since production costs go up, labor costs go up, marketing programs go up, and thus budgets have to go up. Unfortunately it means regurgitating past ideas or serializing whatever worked before in a deadly loop of the medium.

I don't know where movies are going to go after we have exhausted all the ideas for the century beforehand that had brand identity or an existing audience from prior sequels. Will this reverse around and cause some more risk taking and have new ideas? I actually do not think so but I could be wrong. The best scenario would be that movies get more intimate and small and since they cost less, they can be creative works of art that can still be impactful. I do wish for the big budget creative masterpiece and there will be a sprinkling of those over time but the gap between them will be much wider than ever before.

I cancelled my Netflix account as I don't want to be bombarded with choice upon choice and all of it not matter to me. I still search for the movies that I truly want to watch and then find them. It means I watch less stuff but it also means that the stuff I do watch has more meaning. I also know I miss a ton of things potetionally interesting projects but I am not sure I have the bandwidth to filter through it all. There is too much of a good thing and if movies continue this way, they wont be a good thing much longer.
