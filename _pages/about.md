<p>You probably at this site to see some of my work so I'm even more flattered if you spend any time learning about me.</p>

<p>My site is themed around film and many movies are broken into a 3 act structure. Here is how my past is broken down to make me who I am today (and my story is only evolving).</p>

I didnt have a creative outlet when I went to college at UC Davis and ended up majoring in the life sciences, a field I still highly admire but didn't speak to me as a career. I found I needed to balance the heavy sciences with art and film classes to feed my creative urge.

After I finished undergrad, I began thinking I would pursue a job in the film industry but the Internet was roaring and I couldnâ€™t ignore it. I worked at startups and rode IPO bandwagons and then landed at a design agency managing design projects for all kinds of clients.

After my agency role shut down, I realized I had strayed too far from hands-on design and decided to rekindle my portfolio with user experience work. It has leveraged my past divergent experiences very well and allows me to fulfill my dream of telling stories with the marriage of design.

<p>I believe travel is another great way to tell stories and would love to share some of the journeys that I have been on. Here is a shot of my Google maps with pins on places I have been. This is a lifetime passion of minbe that will cause this map to be populated more and more every year.</p>
