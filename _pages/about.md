You probably at this site to see some of my work so I'm even more flattered if you spend any time learning about me.

I'm a design generalist with deep experience working on solving complex creative problems and creating efficient design processes for everything from enterprises to early stage startups.

Here is a sense of my process when starting a new initiative:

Since I'm such a fan of film and dedicated my site to the theme, I'm going to break down my life thus far along the common story telling tactic of the 3 act structure. Now this doesn't mean Act 3 means I'm done. Its just what has made me who I am today but I am just like my designs, a constant iteration to perfection.
