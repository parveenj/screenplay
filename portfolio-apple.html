            <p>
                Apple’s explosive growth after the iPhone’s initial launch, quarter after quarter, is now the story of business legend. Yet, not every department with the company scaled at that same pace. One such department is the Online Support team who did could not scale as fast but had to provide support to the millions of new users who were coming on every quarter.

                I joined this team to help them find ways to automate their current offline processes so that they could scale their efforts to meet the demands of more users.

            <h3>PLAYING PRODUCT MANAGEMENT</h3>
            <p>
                I found out that the assigned Product Manager had already crafted requirements. I wanted to review this documentation so that I could include a design perspective that would add more value about how the user interface should be presented.

            <h3>PROFILING USERS</h3>
            <p>
                The product would involve internal users whom were clearly identified to me so I decided personas were not necessary. I still made user profiles based on the two key types of roles that would be heavy in the app.
