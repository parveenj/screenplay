				<p>
					Welcome my friend! My name is Parveen and I'm a design leader working in the SF Bay Area. I'm a seasoned design professional who begins every project with an open mind and fierce curiosity about people and process.
				</p>
				<p>
					And yet my first love growing up was creative storytelling where I used to spend time writing novels, short stories, and screenplays. If you asked me my dream job in high school, it would have been to write and direct motion pictures as I think its the most engaging story format of all time. These days, I bring this background to every project I work on as build products that engage to it's users. My website is dedicated to the fusion of my past and present since that makes me whole.

		<p>Movies are one of my greatest inspirations and I want to inspire my users in similar ways. Obviously, thats a high bar to surpass but its always good to have ambition, dont you think? As an homage to my past, I put together some case studies in story format using movies as a motif. These are a bit long so if just want to view the final work (spoilers), scroll down or <a href="work.html">go here to see more screens.</a></p>
