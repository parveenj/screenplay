				<p>
					Welcome my friend! My name is Parveen and I'm a design leader working in the SF Bay Area.
				</p>
				<p>
					Growing up, I was passionate about traditional stories and had experience in writing and filming them so that I could connect with my audience. Now, as a product design leader, I bring that background to every project I work on as I try to build products that connect to it's users. This website is dedicated to a fusion of both since it is what makes me whole.

		<p>So what's with this movie theme? In my opinion, movies provide the best story experience of all and if I want to have a similar impact on my users, why not aim high? Regardless, each story below has some details about the highs and lows of the experience and if you came just for spoilers, <a href="#spoilers">check some screens out.</a></p>
