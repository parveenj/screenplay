Oh, this poor portfolio of mine... It has seen more revisions than a Southern California plastic surgeon. Let me explain as I have decided lately to come full circle to how it all started.

So back when I was doing design management related work, I had no need to maintain my portfolio. So when it came time to create one again to show off my design skills, I didn't know exactly where to start and I made everything in plain HTML and CSS. I would then find some good old web host and FTP my pages up and then point a domain name to the index and wipe my hands of everything and move on. I felt after a while that this was not very scalable, especially for a blog as I hoped to have hundreds of articles (oh, ambition).

I found maintaining this site a bit tedious because I would forget how everything was laid out since I touched it only once or twice a year. I'm not so great at documenting my process when the only benefactor is me. So I thought why not try a content management systetm instead? I moved on to Wordpress because I thought, "Why not? it hosts thousands of sitets so it has to be the best!"

I found out the hard way that, although getting a site up and running is a breeze, I couldn't find themes that worked for me and felt I had to customize my own, which turned to be a tedious and time-consuming feat. And managing plugins and their updates was a chore every time I logged in after a while as I had all this bureaucracy to manage before I even got to my own site.

I was not really in the loop regarding new methods to build a website but stumbled across Jekyll when managing the Walmart.com initiative. Their internal teams were using Jekyll with GitHub to publish sites internally. It had been around since 2008 which is a millenia in web development years but I had no real exposure to it before. In fact, I had never even used a static site generator and found it refreshing and convenient. I picked up on all the steps necessary and ultimately loved the idea of version controlling my code through GitHub. Look ma, I'm playing developer!

I find working in plain HTML & CSS so much more refreshing. I mean it just feels like its less weight... it just feels easier. Granted, there is more of a learning curve and Jekyll still has some quirks I have to remember. But the power of utilizing GitHub to manage everything is something revolutionary for this budding techno designer.

Best of all, no hosting fees as I can host my site for free on GitHub pages and deploy it through Netlify.

I've done my portfolio over a dozen times now, toggling between hosts, platforms, tools, and services. Raw HTML and CSS will outlive me so I know working with my new framework will be my final stop in making my little place on the Web my own.

If you build portfolio for yourself, try it out.
