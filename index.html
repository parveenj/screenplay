			<p>
				Welcome my friend! My name is Parveen and I'm a design leader working in the SF Bay Area who begins every project with an open mind and fierce curiosity about people and process.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				And yet, my first love growing up was creative storytelling, when I used to spend time writing novels, short stories, and screenplays. If you asked in high school what my dream job, it would have been to write and direct motion pictures, the most engaging story format of all.
			  </p>
			  <p>	
				This site focuses on my current design work and thoughts but it is also a way for me to reflect on my prior inspirations, representing the fusion of my past with my present that makes me whole.
