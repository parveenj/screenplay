                <p>When a tech company creates a developer portal signals a special time in it's trajectory. It is stating to
                  the world that it is big enough to lure people outside of the company to build on it's platform. You have
                  thousands doing so for companies such as Apple, Google, and Facebook. So when Walmart.com decided it needed
                  to be in the game, they hired me up through Slalom to begin that journey.

                        I have an idea based on hueristics of what developers would need from a portal but it helps to identify the competitve landscape. I did an audit of UIs across various companies and presented features as a matrix. I used this as a conversation piece on what needs to be incorporated to match and exceed the competition and use this when conversating with upper management on scope.

                      <p>
                        I worked with the internal Tools team but with folks who didn't know how to navigate the process of building a portal. Before
                        I start anything, I want to evaluate what currently exists at Walmart and oh boy, I was surprised how many
                        teams had tried to establish this in the past.

                        <p>
                          I managed a small team to work on these deliverables and since everyone I worked with did not understand personas, I focused on just creating high level user profiles to identify who our users would be.

                              Running through all the features available across the web, I narrowed it down to what we should focus on in priorities to better communicate throughout the management teams on what our goals should be.

                            <p>
                                I ran the entire initiative and had to push on how to actually get this built. We had many sessions of breaking the work down between our small core team, which proved challenging since we would need to borrow resources from across the company.

                                I didn't feel anyone was thinking of the product from a bird's eye view and wanted to create diagrams to get them on the same page. I created the diagrams in Confluence and then took it to each team that overlapped with this initiative. After each meeting required me to iterate on the diagram and then revisit the teams for second and third rounds. After 21 versions, I came to a conclusion on what we can build based on user requirements.

                                  I did do some wireframes but again couldn't get my vision across with everyone I met. There were too many projects with too many initiatives to really have a memorable experience. So I then took it directly into Sketch and made some mockups with visual fidelity.

                                    I had to convert designs into HTML/CSS and to do that, we could leverage a Jekyll environment internally so we did that. Regretfully the environment isn't dynamic so we couldn't really push anything out other than static pages but at least it was enough to get the portal up and running as a first step.

                                    <p>
                                        We had a very iterative product but came at a real sticking point when it came to moving beyond having the site be a set of static pages. The first feature as such was the Login ability that users would need to make this site unique to their needs and my opinion was a must have. Most internal resources would push to create a new login feature but I pushed for the convenience of the user and leverage the Walmart.com login. I had to research how other portals did it to defend this decision. It was a lot of extra dev work but buy in from everyone involved.

                                      <h3>CONVERSION TO REACT</h3>
                                      <p>
                                          As a parallel effort, there was the need to move from Jekyll into a more dynamic environment. The team concluded that React would work since it was so popular inside of Walmart so we leveraged that. I had to figure out how to now convert the entire design architecture into a whole new format due to the nature of React. This was fun to learn but also a very messy process and we basically rebuilt the site twice! I began to iterate on designs in a more organic way and could stop worrying about how to support features and actively build them.
