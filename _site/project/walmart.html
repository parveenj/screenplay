<p>Walmart Affiliates posed to me a query on establishing a new experience for its core users. They wanted to establish a new product for their users but how is it best to create an enterprise play within a consumer giant? As an external consultant, I had to find the best path forward.</p>

<p>[Graphic of Walmart movie poster]</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>I sat alone with my client team concerned about where I should start as nobody had any experience in such matters. I felt it was good to onboard and educate them to the design process. This team would need a lot of team members to implement this but had only the budget for me so far.</p>

<p>[Graphic of multiple roles coming together: Product Manager, UX Designer, Front End Programmer, Content Writer, Marketing Manager]</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>I began this effort with a deep dive of the competition to help me strategize on priorities. We can’t plan for a team and a roadmap without identifying what it is we build. I collected user feedback from past emails that were sent in and interviewed teams internally.</p>

<p>[Graphic of screenshots of competitive sites: Uber, Facebook, Apple, Google]</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>I didn’t feel it was enough to just spit out my user requirements to the client by bullet point as it kills attention spans. I enlisted the help of a technical writer from my personal contacts who understood technical documentation and help me forge my bullets into a personality.</p>

<p>[Graphic of Walmart I/O initial concept and a PowerPoint slide showing priorities]</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>I presented this and the client was pleased that I was herding cats and I can tell he was more confidence in my approach. So I pushed onward to learn about Walmart API implementation in general. This was a minefield of discovery with every step forcing a new bomb to my consciousness.</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>At this point I was more concerned about how to implement than what to implement. Walmart wasn’t the easiest place to get things done with a lack of process between groups and no documentation on how to do anything. But I forged on making relationships and understanding people both internally and externally and what I wanted to get done.</p>

<p>[Graphic of meeting notes on whiteboards and overall integration diagram]</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>We pushed an initial build out on a Jekyll platform with the help of my technical writer. This was an early stage beta release and didn’t need a ton of integration since it was self sufficient (for now). I got some help when it came to hosting the site internally to Walmart but had to really push myself to get basic pages up.</p>

<p>[Graphic of V1 of Walmart.io]</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>We had to now share this new experience up to the different teams that we partnered with up to this point. It was time to take the experience to the product up to a V2 at this point. The first thing users would need is a login experience and so I pushed for leveraging the Walmart.com user account.</p>

<p>[2 graphics of Walmart login and interaction design of login flow]</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>Adding in new features to make the login relevant was necessary next. We reviewed the interaction design and what was needed to pull it all off. I couldn’t do it alone and got management to add in a front-end developer.</p>

<p>10</p>

<p>After rolling this feature out, we saw a major spike of traffic onto the site. I collected feedback from users to get a better understanding of what was working and what was not.</p>

<p>11</p>

<p>Now that there is a place of a complete product, it is time to do a proper marketing push and that is where the story ends. As Walmart dawns this new product to the world with expectation of thousands of new users, I feel confident it will continue to meet the demands of it users.</p>

<p>12</p>

<p>In parallel, I shared the new affiliates experience with partners who would be on boarded onto the platform as initial testers. They gave constructive feedback that I wanted to apply but the feedback was positive. Because of this, I got funding for the team to add a new backend engineer to deliver on more features.</p>
