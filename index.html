				<p>
					Welcome my friend! My name is Parveen and I'm a design leader working in the SF Bay Area. I'm a seasoned design professional who begins every project with an open mind and fierce curiosity about people and process.
				</p>
				<p>
					And yet, my first love growing up was creative storytelling, when I used to spend time writing novels, short stories, and screenplays. If you asked me what my dream job was when I was in high school, it would have been to write and direct motion pictures as I thought it was the most engaging story format of all time. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					These days, I bring this background to every project I work on as build products that engage with it's users. This website is about my recent design work but also inspired by my pre-digital inspirations, a fusion of my past and present that makes me whole.

		<p>Movies are one of my greatest inspirations and I want to inspire my users in similar ways. Obviously, thats a high bar to pass but its always good to have ambition, dont you think? As an homage to my past, I put together some case studies using movies as a motif. These are a bit long so if just want to view the final work (spoilers), scroll down or <a href="work.html">go here to see more screens.</a></p>
