### Background
Anomalie was founded by a husband and wife CEO team to do what has never been done before: let brides build a custom wedding dress online. They had growth hacked their business to be sustainable but how do they become more product focused to take it a step above? This was cruical to solve to gain traction so that they can one day go beyond wedding dresses to all of women's apparel.

### Story

I was recruited by the Chief Experience Officer as a management consultant to help drive the creation of the new product initiative. I took pride in being able to craft myself as both a product and design mentor to the young company looking for direction.

#### Stepping into Product Management

My first thought was to get to know my users better. Business analysts were conducting interviews with the management stakeholders and I got myself invited. As we ran through these, I felt the actual specialists were getting ignored so I interviewed them on my own for a more holistic picture.

The company had no documentation on what it was doing in the past and where it should go in the future. Knowing that I want to have some foundation, my first task in consulting with the Chief Experience Officer was to document how the company even wanted to move forward.

I want requirements to be pulled together and I want everyone to sign off on it. Otherwise, why do something to only realize it was not the intention of everyone? I want transparency so I consulted with the co-founders and other key stakeholders in the company and put together some Google docs that everyone could see at one time.

#### Requirements are key

I did a mini roadshow, something that is silly for a company this size, but reviewed my requirements in great detail with everyone involved. I think requirements need to document the product use case and how it is going to benefit the customers AND the business. I asked for a formal signoff from the co-founders and the Chief Experience and Technical Officers before doing any design.

#### Design Research is the next step

We did some light white board sketches during requirements gathering but those sessions where about what was currently broken and how to address them. It did not cover actual design so I got to jump right in with some blank canvas thinking. Schedules are compressed and very free form so there isn't a ton of time to do a lot of brainstorming. I led some competitive analysis reviews with the other design consultant and pulled together some direction.

I asked for client feedback and had to dig to pull some of it out but a lot of it came from my interviews as part of requirements gathering.

#### Managing Sketch in a Jungle

I managed the design team in terms of executing upon the requirements but there were 3 different resources spread across different locations. Not to mention all the stakeholders who also needed to provide input on design. This led to many many many different versions where we needed to consolidate.

#### New Design Roadmap

There were two pathways for design, the experience for stylists and the experience for brides. Out of research and heuristics, our main theme for the brides was visibility. Visibility into the dress creation process and the production process once they signed up. The theme for stylists was focused around education. Give stylists the ability to be more educated when they help their customers. This led to some big reworking of the internal and external applications... all in a matter of weeks.

When getting feedback, not everything really sunk in. I pushed to get everything in Invision so we can play it out with the stakeholders. I would have used Figma but the company setup an account on Invision only.

#### Feedback better late than never

Turning raw clay to statue, I approach that process in generating polished wireframes through countless iteration.

### Resolution
The Apple customer support team was very grateful for the attention to their needs and requested me to join a new initiative to take the project to the next level 6 months later. Alas, I was already occupied on another role but grateful for the ask.
