Facebook as a platform has immense reach and is an increasingly important place for small and medium sized businesses to leverage for marketing. Due to this growth, Facebook’s Small & Medium Business (SMB) marketing team was dealing with growing pains in terms of keeping up with the demand when it came to generating and managing campaigns. This business unit was built with a grass roots approach and had crafted processes on the fly to keep up with demand but everyone knew it was not scalable long term.

We partnered with Facebook’s team and took a people-first, human-centric approach to building their new platform. In doing so, we identified over a dozen different processes split across tools required to launch ad campaigns. Our approach harmonized these experiences into one unified platform with role-based activities. In the final sprint of the engagement, we built an enhanced dashboard experience with a global view of campaign details and a data-rich front-end.

#### MODULE 1 DISCOVERY
To build products that people love, you have to establish a meaningful understanding of the people themselves.

In order to do this, I set out to understand the SMB team’s current workflow. This consisted of one-on-one interviews that involved speaking to Marketers and Analysts and observing their current daily process. It was helpful to see how they used multiple tools to perform very simple actions. Since we had no direct access to these products ourselves, we were to able to observe their frustrations and pain points first hand. We were shocked at how many processes were performed manually and required deep SQL building skills with arcane interfaces. This ultimately made work for the SMB unit inefficient and introduced lots of errors.

#### CURRENT TOOLS
In addition to understanding users and their processes, it was important for us to audit the existing toolset t0 learn the individual features and find opportunities for efficiency and simplification.

Besides working with the actual future end users of the product, it was important to sync up with the builders. Working with the lead developers, we went over the flow of information as it was currently configured. At a fast break pace that is Facebook, not everything was properly documented so we actually helped the developers learn to look at the big picture.

#### ESTABLISHING A DIRECTION
Collaborating directly with users resulted in quicker alignment to goals, objectives and overall product strategy. Impromptu whiteboarding sessions, iterative concept sketching and low fidelity wireframe prototyping produced quick results for establishing a design direction.

#### DELIVERING MODULE 1
End-user feedback and iterative design processes provide valuable feedback when creating clickable prototypes with robust, engineering ready experiences.


#### MODULE 2 DISCOVERY
The design process went back to the drawing board with more sessions for discovering how to solve the problems.

#### WIREFRAME ITERATION
The XD team presented wireframes of the main dashboard to garner feedback.

#### DELIVERING MODULE 2
By creating new wireframes in Invision, the XD team created a clickable prototype that allowed the marketing team to dive into the main user flows as well as the micro-interactions they helped cultivate.
