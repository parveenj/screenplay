                                <p class="sp-margin-0 pt-2">Ever since I was born, my imagination kept me zen. I channeled my energy into crafting stories with full illustrations from as young as 6 years old. Books and movies were gasoline that powered this engine.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="inner-box p-5">
                                <p class="sp-margin-0 pt-2">I was not a product of a creative environment and was forced to picture a future of science. As a high school student having to think about my future, the idea of being creative to earn a living was as much science fiction as some of the movies and books I loved. I went to UC Davis with the expectation I would go into the health sciences. All through college, I had other passions but didn't know how to pull the trigger and since I'm by nature very loyal to finish what I start, I graduated with a B.S. in Biology.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="inner-box p-5">
                                <p class="sp-margin-0 pt-2">Upon graduation, I had decided that since my science obligation has been filled, I would try something creative as I knew there were career options on the other side of the table. I started making little movies and learning computer animation and took on more classes to establish that itch. I saw the Internet exploding around me but it wasn't as much a story medium as filmmaking was so I started with this as my risk taking venture. </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="inner-box p-5">
                                <p class="sp-margin-0 pt-2">It was a fun time exploring this itch but I realized it was a long path to a proper career, ripe with uncertainty. Thus I decided to apply these design skills to the Internet that was flourishing around me. I knew this would have my back and it was beckoning me every month with new opportunity. I did grow up in the San Francisco Bay Area so I didn't have to move far to pursue the nascent field of web design. This had my hooks into me from the beginning and I have been in it ever since, through bubble to recession and back. I have made it my lifeblood and have brought my interest in stories, filmmaking, and design to every project I have started. </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="inner-box p-5">
                                <p class="sp-margin-0 pt-2">I am a generalist when it comes to design. Since I've got ample experience (I guess I'm getting old) across many types of projects, I have exposure to the full design lifecycle at my repotoire. I treat my process as a holistic experience as a means to get a complete product out the door and in front of users. I work with my business units to understand the time and cost to bring products to market and bundle that with my love to make users have interesting tools to do their jobs. Therefore its hard to dislike any step of the process if I keep this in mind and have done user research, wireframes, prototyping, and visual design.</p>

                                <p class="sp-margin-0 pt-2">I do my work because I love it. I love that I can bring myself to my career and give it all I have. I love being creative and helping to make products easier for people who's lives depend upon it. Hopefully if you are reading this, I will get to learn more about you and have the chance to build something with you. I think it would be a great ride.</p>
