                    <p>
                        Anyone who has breathed the last few years knows that social media has taken over journalism and that publications are struggling to keep up with dwindling attention. This may not be bad enough to shut down the New York Times but it will do great damage to smaller publishers who have less advertising revenue. I met with the CEO of Rune who had the goal of leverging people's social graphs to drive traffic to publications and not away from them.

                I had joined the startup with some work already done by the engineering teams. I came onboard as the first true designer and the one who would lead everyone in regards to transforming code into a more branded and engaging experience. I started by identifying the end to end flow of the experience so I had a holistic picture of all interactions.

              <h3>FAMILIAR WITH PUBLISHERS</h3>
              <p>
                We had technically not launched anywhere but there were some trail runs. A launch with the publisher Boing Boing would be upcoming. Our widget would be placed on their website so it was visible inside browsers whether it was via desktop or mobile. Mobile being a constraining factor, I tried out various potential publishers on my phone to get familiar. I also got to be introduced to some publishers as a means to understand their concerns and analytics. Learn about your stakeholders and what their needs are as its not just about the users.

              <h3>MOVE FAST AND PUBLISH</h3>
              <p>
                In most projects, I would ask for  more time to deep dive into user behavior and analytics but I had to scan through what limited details I was able to collage and start thinking about my approach. I leveraged that to begin with creating mockups to get buy in for an intial build internally. I had to do this mockup process super fast since a new prototype was expected at the publishers within a few weeks!

              <h3>DESIGN BUY IN</h3>
              <p>
                I presented a few mockups to get buy in with the other executives at Rune (which was at 4 when I joined). They fell in love with my approach as I had to sell them on as lightweight a design as I could possibly maintain. We went for less than 4kb in added weight to the pageload and used mobile as the platform constraint. I suggested all views should stick to the mobile view only.

                <h3>IMPLEMENTATION INTO PRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>
                  I had to convert my own designs into front end code and then integrate that into the Rune codebase. This had me quite nervous since I was not used to publishing straight to production. I had to build the UI layer on top of the engine that powered the engine on the backend. I struggled with this the most and I would have just done my design mocks in code if I had to redo over again. I could not use any frameworks or grids as the design had to stay lightweight so I ultimately had to leverage a lot of front end dev help from others to deliver on time.

                <p>
                  The main concept around Rune was that of magic and I thought it would be get to play with the icon that would drive the design of the application. It had to be a design that could sit on a busy page and be intuitive enough to have users want to interact with it. It had to stand out on busy pages with lots of busy content and advertisements.

              <h3>PUBLISH ON BOING BOING</h3>
              <p>
                After getting buy in from the internal team and then presenting the flow both in Invision and in real code with Boing Boing, we were set to launch on our very first major publisher. Boing Boing had 1M visits per day and was a mid sized publisher who could push the entire company forward. The company inserted Rune's code onto its publishing platform and ran integration steps with us, which caused me to have to innovate on some of the design in real time. I had to debug late into the night with the whole Rune team but once it cleared all bugs, we were able to release to production.
