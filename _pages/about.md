You probably are here to see some of my work. You can check that out on the Work link but let's get comfy here and get to know the man behind the work.

I'm a seasoned Internet professional who started in the consumer space and have specialized in the enterprise design space for the past few years.

<td>I dreamt big time about being a film director as it was the closest I had to bringing stories to life with the richness of sound and visuals. I didn't have a lavish upbringing so I resorted to writing screenplays, drawing storyboards, creating novels, and sketching ideas.</td>

<tr>
<td>I fell into a science program at my university for lack of a better path for my interests. I broke into the Internet industry in the dawn of the sunset of the 1.0 crash and without much to build upon. I stuck to my guns as a designer as the industry as a whole tried to figure out what our role should be doing.</td>

<tr>
<td>Design is in a very ambitious place in the tech sector now and I have a pivotal role to play alongside it. I'm thrilled I overcame my challenges to find roles where I can express myself. It's great to be in an industry that respects me for who I am. It's not a perfect happy ending but even though I'm not making movies, I'm still having an impact on many people with my work.</td>
