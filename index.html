						Hello friend! My name is Parveen and as a child, I dreamt of creating stories to connect my vision with other people. Now as an adult, I am a design leader who builds experiences that connect people to each other.

					<p class="spacer1">Most of my work has been for the enterprise web, which I have done with some of the biggest names in the valley.</p>

					<p>I have fashioned this site and my case studies around the theme of my favorite story medium of all time: movies. I'm very passionate about how it builds a story and engages an audience. My goal is to find such an engagement to share my work so check out some of my stories below. </p>
