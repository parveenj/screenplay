				Mark your calendars: The only total lunar eclipse of 2019 is set to happen Sunday night, with a little something extra.

				As the full moon passes through the shadow of the Earth, a number of factors will combine to create a so-called “super blood wolf moon.” The eclipse will be visible from anywhere in the U.S. for 62 minutes on Sunday night, as well as South America and parts of Europe and Africa.
