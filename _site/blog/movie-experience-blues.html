				<p>I know what you are thinking: “Wait a minute, let me get this straight? You theme your site around how important movies are to you and then turn around and say it’s just not the same?” Both statements can be equally valid, so let me unpack some more.</p>

<p>Movies were my lifeblood as a kid. That doesn’t mean I watched them endlessly… it just means that I would consume them like a fine wine (which I did not drink as a kid, of course). I built up anticipation about a particular movie for weeks and sometimes months since I could read about them well before they would get released. It made it all the more enjoyable when I finally got to watch it and reflect on the experience. When a movie turns out to be good, it becomes a truly memorable journey.</p>

<p>Nowadays? Well, it seems like trying to have that cadence is almost nonexistent. I know I am so busy that I have little time to keep up with the latest movies, which has caused some of this malaise. I think the more significant factor is just the way our culture now consumes movies in general as it’s impact on pop culture is far less meaningful. Yes, the occasional movie gets hyped up, but it’s mostly superhero blockbusters or the rare award-winning flick because of some Oscar campaign. We rarely have the kind of sticking power with movies as we are always off to the next screen.</p>

<p>Movies will be around forever in some format or another as there is proof that video tends to be one of the biggest lures for online media user retention. It’s way more fun for my son to watch YouTube than to read something. Yet with this constant steady stream of content, there will be less anticipation for that next great work of art, and you will forget it quicker all the same. Our phones are bad enough at distracting us during the movie itself, but once it’s done, the movie may become a distant memory due to sensory overload on the second screen.</p>

<p>I understand why Netflix and any other streaming service tries to force you to stay on their platform as much as possible. Not everyone wants to have a discussion about what they have watched. But when you don’t think about it, you don’t get to personalize what it means to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don’t see any way out of this. There is too much content and too much noise. It’s hard to appreciate something as being a lasting artifact. Most of my favorites are all over a decade old, although I come across a gem every now and again, it’s just that the rate of finding a favorite has dropped significantly. The one value of streaming services is that I can rewatch some of these movies more easily, and maybe repeat viewings will help stick in our consciousness better.</p>

<p>The worst part of all of this? A lack of risk-taking to tell unique stories. As mentioned before, there is a flood of the same blockbuster movies coming out that garner all the attention. Or the remake of a classic that nobody asked for but has brand awareness. Or bringing some familiar toy product to life in a narrative format. Or trotting out a familiar character in a new adventure because we loved them as kids. I feel that film creativity peaked in the 1970s as mainstream blockbuster movies back then were bespoke narratives that involved a lot more risk to sell to a mass audience. Just go back and look at what was the top box office draw each of those years and compare them to now.</p>

<p>Filmmakers who love to express themselves will have fewer options to find investment into a unique vision. Do you think the lack of risk-taking will mean that production companies will fund some random kid’s imagination to be the next Scorcese or Speilberg? Making movies is getting more and more expensive since production, labor, and marketing costs have gone way up, and the chance of profit has gone down with increased content everywhere.</p>

<p>I don’t know where movies will be in a few decades after we have exhausted most of the ideas from the century beforehand that had some brand identity. Will this reverse around and cause some more risk-taking and deliver us new ideas? I actually do not think so, but I could be wrong. The best scenario would be that movies that are nimble and small in budget will carry some creativity forward, and occasionally, some of them will become pieces of art that expand our culture. There will be fewer big-budget creative masterpieces, but even a sprinkling of those over time will teach future audiences the potential that resides within us.</p>

<p>I still search for the movies that I genuinely want to watch and then find them. It means I watch less stuff, but it also means that the movies I DO watch has some meaning. I also know I miss a ton of things potentially exciting projects, but I am not sure I have the bandwidth to filter through it all. There is too much of a good thing, and if movies continue this way, I worry they won’t be a good thing much longer.</p>
